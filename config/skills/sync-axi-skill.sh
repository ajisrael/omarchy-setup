# copy shipped inside the pinned, globally installed npm package itself
# (each of the axi-family packages ships skills/<name>/SKILL.md in its own
# npm `files` list), with every `npx -y <pkg>` invocation rewritten to a
# plain call to the installed binary.
#
# Run via home.nix's installAxi activation block (which runs
# config/skills/install-axi.sh) right after `npm install -g <pkg>@<version>`,
# so bumping the pinned version there and running ./rebuild.sh regenerates
# the matching local skill automatically - no manual re-copy/re-diff against
# the upstream skill file needed.

## Version pinning on this machine

Do not run \`${pkg} update\` - it self-updates via npm and would drift from
the version pinned in omarchy-setup's \`config/skills/install-axi.sh\`, until
the next \`./rebuild.sh\` silently reinstalls the pinned version over it. To
upgrade, tell the user to bump the pinned version in
\`config/skills/install-axi.sh\` and run \`./rebuild.sh\` - that regenerates
this skill file to match automatically.
\`${pkg} update --check\` (read-only, does not install) is still fine to run.
